excerpt: " Lesson2 ~~~ Sometimes it is nice to programmatically run .sql scripts 
on a MySQL database using Java.  This is easily accomplished using the 
allowMultiQueries configuration property for the MySQL Connector/J driver.  
When set to true it allows the use of ‘;’ to delimit multiple queries."
