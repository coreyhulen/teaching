# Questions to Ask

1. Grab an arduino from the parts bin.
1. We're going to follow the blink LED example.
1. Can you find an LED you want to blink?
1. Can you find a 330 ohm resistor?
1. Do you remember what a resistor does?
1. I showed them my multi-meter and let the ask questions.
1. Notice the Ohms symbol on the multi-meter? what is that for?
1. Show them how to measure the resistance of a resistor.
1. Notice the volts symbol on the multi-meter? what is that for?
1. Show them how to measure the volts.
1. Type in line-by-line the example and explain each line
1. What do you think each line is doing?
1. Why does delay have a value of 1000?
1. What would happens if we changed that?
1. Can you make it blink faster?
1. Can you make it blink slower?
1. Can you make the LED appear DIM?
1. Can you make it blink so fast you cannot see it?
